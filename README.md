# Local asdf initial setup

    asdf plugin-add golang https://github.com/kennyp/asdf-golang.git 
    # for other golang requirements for your os go to https://github.com/kennyp/asdf-golang
    asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
    asdf plugin-add rust https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-rust.git 

    # Then run
    asdf install

# Running e2e tests

The e2e tests run inside of a k8s cluster. They will run against whatever cluster your current kubectl context is set to. This can be an external k8s cluster or a local one (using something like minikube or k3d). 

Note: If running against a local k8s cluster, make sure you have plenty of ram allocated for docker, 12 gb if running individual tests and a lot more if you run parallel test like the ones in `make test_smoke` since it runs multiple tests in parallel

Steps to run the e2e tests:

1. Build using the `make build` command. If you have previously built and made changes to artficats and want to make sure you have a clean starting point you can run `make artifacts_clean` before building.
2. Make sure your kubectl context is pointing to the cluster you want to run tests against.
3. Run a test, you have several options
    - `make test_smoke` will run the ocr2, ocr2 proxy, and gauntlet e2e tests (all three run in parallel)
    - `make test_ocr` will run the ocr2 e2e tests
    - `make test_ocr_proxy` will run the ocr2 tests using a proxy
    - `make test_gauntlet` will run the gauntlet e2e tests
    - `make test_migration` will run the migration e2e tests
    - `make test_chaos` will run the chaos tests

You can always look at the [Makefile](./Makefile) in this repo to see other commands or tests that have been added since this readme was last updated.
